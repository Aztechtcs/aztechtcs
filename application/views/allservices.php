Also, we build online interactive communities that allow patients and providers to improve their health, drive better clinical outcomes, reduce costs, and make advancements in clinical research. Our integration specialists are also highly conversant with the HIPAA 4010/5010 Eligibility, Claims, Remittance and Referral Management transaction sets.

                         With so much of our daily business being conducted on the web, it's important for your website to be accessible by visitors with various disabilities. We can make most sites accessible revising the content with proven best practices. Since great websites require constant attention, it's also recommended that organizations establish an accessibility policy to maintain high standards.
                    <br/>
                    
                        Title III of the ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) has been upheld by the Department of Justice as requiring organizations that offer services to the public to provide accessible website content. Though specific guidelines have never been provided, we recommend that larger organizations — or those who wish to serve the widest possible customer base — pursue high accessibility standards.
                        <br>
                      <li>  <strong>Accessibility Repairs</strong>

Based on findings from the Accessibility Report, the AZTECHTCS development team works with your staff to implement the recommended fixes. We’ll provide a list of changes that were made, to ensure that the problems found during the Accessibility Report have been addressed.

<li><strong>Internal Accessibility Policy</strong>
<br/>
A AZTECHTCS consultant works with your web maintenance team to develop a company policy for site maintenance. This ensures that your site remains highly accessible as your team adds new content. You’ll receive a policy document outlining how ADA requirements should be considered as content moves through your editorial process and onto the website, as well as any specific techniques needed to ensure a high level of accessibility.

                        Businesses nowadays have hundreds of applications implemented at various points during their growth cycle. These applications have varying levels of maturity, performance and ability to talk to third party applications as they are implemented at various points of time and technological evolution. Over time, these applications fall out of line with the business direction and hence need continual effort at alignment. This is over and above the regular support and maintenance.

                        AztechTCS’s Application Maintenance Service helps clients to take a step back and look at their application portfolio from a fresh new perspective that is a blend of macro level business alignment and micro level usability and performance issues, before beginning to deliver value.  AztechTCS always endeavours to understand the client, their business and objectives along with the processes before we dive into the technological support to deliver results.

                        Every business is unique in itself. So packaged application solutions, however comprehensive, may not always be able to support every aspect of business processes. That is when businesses need partners to help them with end-to-end custom application development. Such a need for application development may arise in a variety of business cases ranging from Legacy Transformation to Greenfield Application Development, from Third-Party Integration to Enhancements and Upgrades, from launching new platforms like mobiles to disruptive frameworks like cloud. 
                        <br/>
                        The application development may take place as custom, web based or mobile application with the help of robust methodologies such as Agile, Waterfall or Iterative, using development platforms such as Microsoft, Oracle or others.
